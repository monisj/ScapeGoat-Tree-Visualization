# ScapeGoat-Tree-Visualization
The Following Project Is A GUI Based Scapegoat Tree Visualizer that contains two examples and a user input scapegoat tree 

1. There is A LibraryMustInstall.txt file that includes directions to all the libraries that were used to code this project

2. You Must use the latest version of python(at the time of writting version 3.8) to run the project as some libraries like wxpython would not work

3. The GraphWiz library must be installed via the installer do not use the pip command to install it as it has a path error related to its graph plotting function

4. Instructions:
```
1. The First Two buttons in the GUI will provide you with an example of a normal unbalanced BST to 
   Balance BST/ScapeGoat Tree
2. Click The Create Tree Button To Create your Tree
3. Enter the amount Nodes (This should be equal to the no of nodes Enter below) i.e 6
4. Enter The List of Nodes not edge list the program would create the edgelist automatically as 
   soon as you enter your node list either sorted or unsorted (Any wrong input will result in an 
   error not a crash and the program will prompt you to enter it again) i.e [6,1,3,5,4,2]
5. Click The Show tree button to show your newly created ScapeGoat Tree(Again the Program will prompt
   You with an error if you have clicked the button before creating the tree)
